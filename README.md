## About Me / Background Context

Having reached the status of mid-career professional at 44 years of age and after having been blessed to have worked for the Government of Canada for more than 20 years, I am now embarking on a major career pivot and shifting my profession direction to tap back into the creative and entrepreneurial sides of my personality!

In my personal life, I am married to an amazing spouse, Mandy, and we are proud parents of an 8-year old son, Mackayden Sangiuliano Daniels! I am also a semi-proud “pet parent” (comparatively speaking) to 4 eccentric and seemingly indifferent indoor house cats, Smokey, Bubble, Trouble and 'tis Minou!!   }:-)

> I want to see more beauty and understanding in the world.

Believe it or not, this exact phrase popped into my head right in the middle of an early morning jog back in August 2020 and I quickly emailed it to myself during the run so that I wouldn’t forget it...

It was surely a flash of inspiration and I have since come to think of it as a serendipitous moment of discovering my individual **WHY** statement or personal mission declaration! 

## Description of Challenges Encountered During Development

One of the major challenges that I faced during the devlopment of my portfolio web site is that as a part-time student exceptionally participating in what is intended to be a full-time program, I am not currently enrolled in the User Experience Design course that is assumed to be taken in parallel and is supposed to provide the initial prototype design of the overall web site structure. 

For that reason, I have been trying to play catch-up and complete a full design concept in advance of the programming work, but it has often felt like trying to design and code my portfolio web site at the same time. In fact, I would compare the experience to the often-quoted expression of "building the airplane while in-flight", but it has been a very positive experience overall and I am excited to see the finished web site offering (as I am not yet finished the development at the time of writing this comment... }:-).  

## My Top 5 "Lessons Learned" From the Creation of My Portfolio Web Site

1. First Lesson Learned - It is much better to remain patient, even when experiencing the inevitable glitches and unexpected complications that arise from time to time.
2. Second Lesson Learned - The process of selecting, consolidating and editing the various portfolio images took so much longer than I would have previously estimated, by a huge margin!
3. Third Lesson Learned - Effective visual communication and elegant design trumps flashy animations and technical 'cleverness', no matter how tempting it may seem.
4. Fourth Lesson Learned - The process of finding the 'right' combination of complimentary fonts, colour palettes and personal aesthetics served as a gratifying experience of discovery.
5. Fifth Lesson Learned - I was reminded that I really enjoy this type of work, as I especially loved tackling the creative and technical challenges of web design!
